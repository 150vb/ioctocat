# iOctocat - GitHub for iOS

iOctocat is a GitHub app for your iOS devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch).
The prior v1 is open source and the current v2 is [available on the App Store](http://ioctocat.com/appstore-iphone).

I removed the contents of this repo, because people kept confusing this for the current version that is
available n the App Store. Please note that the source is still available and can be used, just go back
to [the last commit](/dennisreimann/ioctocat/commit/f6a31575707b0a51609a40bb32089eea97841612) - just keep
in mind that this version is not updated for iOS 7.
