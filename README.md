## Building and Debugging

In order to build iOctocat on your own, install the following prerequisites:

  * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
  * [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

Here are some tips for providing debugging information along with issues.
iOctocat logs all API calls and in the console you will find the debugging output.

  * Clone the repo and open the terminal with the directory you cloned it into

        git clone git://github.com/dennisreimann/ioctocat.git
        cd ioctocat

  * Install the submodules:

        git submodule update --init

  * Install the dependencies

        pod install

  * Create the `HockeySDK.plist` file by copying the sample:

        cp HockeySDK{.sample,}.plist

  * Open the project in Xcode

        open iOctocat.xcworkspace

  * Select "iOctocat > iPhone Simulator" in the upper left corner
  * Build and run the app by pressing the play button
  * Activate the debug console by selecting "View > Debug Area > Activate Console"
  * Clear the console (Cmd + K)
  * Move to where the error occurs
  * Copy the output in the console and attach it to your bug report

### Debugging API responses

In the Debug directory is a ruby script to check the returned JSON of the
GitHub.com API. Authentication is optional and is done via HTTP Basic Auth
in case a username and password are provided. Usage:

    Debug/api.rb PATH [USERNAME] [PASSWORD]

Example:

    Debug/api.rb user/repos your_github_username your_password

This scripts writes the output and additional debugging information to a
log file in the Debug directory. Please attach the output of this script
to your issues.

In case you are using a Ruby version prior to 1.9 (find out with `ruby -v`)
you will need to install the json gem with this command:

    gem install json

## Running the tests

To run the (sparse) test suite, you can build/test the iOctocat Unit Tests scheme.

To make the tests run from the command line you have to install ios-sim:

    brew install ios-sim

Use this command to run the tests from the iOctocat directory:

    TestScripts/run_tests_from_cli.rb

To run the tests on every file change, you can install Guard and its accompanying
ruby gems via Bundler:

    bundle install

After that you can start guard with this command:

    bundle exec guard
