h1. iOctocat

iOctocat is a GitHub client for the iPhone.
Currently the application is in an early stage and there is nothing
to see but your private timeline and your activity feed, yet.

My approach is to keep it very minimalistic, but there are a 
few more features on the TODO list...

h2. TODO

* Profile View 
* Repository Details
* Repository Watchlist

h2. Features so far

* My Private News Feed
* My Activity Feed
