h1. iOctocat

iOctocat is a GitHub client for the iPhone.
Currently the application is in a very early stage and there
nothing to see but your private timeline, yet.

My approach is to keep it very minimalistic, but there are a 
few more features on the TODO list...

h2. TODO

* My Public News Feed
